      <div class="flex-container" id="options-flex">
        <div class="option"><h3>CBT</h3>

          <p class="p-option">CBT is a widely used modern approach. It focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors. Clients learn practical strategies to change their thinking and improve emotional well-being</p></div>
        <div class="option"><h3>Psychodynamic</h3><br>
          <pc class="p-option">Rooted in Freudian theory, psychodynamic counseling emphasizes building strong therapistâ€“client alliances. The goal is to help clients develop psychological tools to cope with complex feelings and situations. Freud also focused on early experiences and unconscious drives.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="option"><h3>Mindfulness</h3><br>
          <p class="p-option">Mindfulness-based approaches draw from Eastern traditions and emphasize present-moment awareness. Clients learn to observe thoughts and emotions without judgment. Techniques include meditation, breathing exercises, and body scans.</p></div>
